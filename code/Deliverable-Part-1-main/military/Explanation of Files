Final Code Uploads:
Each scraper extracts what the name suggests. Important Notes:
AIRCRAFT Scraper extracts from https://www.wdmma.org/
NAVAL Scraper extracts from https://www.wdmmw.org/
ARMOR Scraper extracts from https://www.militaryfactory.com/
LANDPOWER/MANPOWER Scrapers extract from https://www.globalfirepower.com/

IGNORE scrape_military_firepower.py -- its an old file that gets a lot of data but its not very organized. Can still be usefuly if needed.

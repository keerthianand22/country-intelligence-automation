# Country Intelligence Automation Platform

This project was developed as part of an internship with a **Fortune 500 major American defense contractor**. It focuses on automating the collection, analysis, and visualization of global country intelligence data to support strategic and defense-related decision-making. The project was showcased at the INFORMS 2025 Analytics+ Conference.

## Project Overview

Traditionally, country-level research required extensive manual effort. To streamline this process, we designed and built an automated intelligence-gathering system that pulls economic, military, geopolitical, and environmental data for all 195 countries using Python-based web scraping and visualizes it through dynamic Power BI dashboards.

## Objective

To create a centralized, automated platform that:
- Collects and updates real-time country intelligence data
- Reduces manual research time and improves consistency
- Enables faster, data-driven decision-making for analysts

## Data Sources

- CIA World Factbook
- World Bank Open Data
- Global military and trade datasets
- Regional news APIs for sentiment analysis
- Custom web scraping scripts using BeautifulSoup and Selenium

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline**:
  - Scrapes key intelligence indicators for all 195 countries
  - Covers GDP, military stats, natural resources, geography, trade flows, and climate

- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Uses NLP to analyze news articles by country
  - Ranks sentiment scores for geopolitical and economic events

- **Interactive Power BI Dashboards**:
  - Country-level filtering and comparisons
  - Visual insights into risk, opportunity, and stability
  - Drill-downs by topic: Defense, Climate, Trade, Economy, Geography

## Technologies Used

- Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Pandas)
- Microsoft Power BI (custom dashboards, slicers, map visuals)
- Scikit-learn & PyTorch (for NLP sentiment scoring)
- Microsoft Power Automate (for data refresh scheduling)

## Business Impact

- Reduced manual research time by **90%**
- Enabled faster country briefings for internal stakeholders
- Provided a scalable framework for continuous intelligence monitoring
- Informed global risk mitigation and opportunity strategies

## Achievements

- Developed during internship with a **Fortune 500 major American defense contractor**
- Presented at **INFORMS 2025 Analytics+ Conference**
- Contributed to the firmâ€™s submission for the **Future Edelman Impact Award**
